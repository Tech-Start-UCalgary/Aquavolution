# Aquavolution
Aquavolution is a browser-based survival/adventure 2D game made with Unity.

## Inspiration
PROTECTING THE OCEANS:
They are not in the maps, but Earth now has 5 plastic islands. Ocean currents cause “gyres” and the plastic accumulates there. One of these islands is the size of United Sates!
