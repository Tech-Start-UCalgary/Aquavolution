## Inspiration
We created the idea for Aquavolution after combining the want to spread the importance of protecting our oceans and having fun at the same time where you start as a fish in the current world's oceans and try to defeat the largest predatory fish that exists!
They are not in the world maps, but Earth now has 5 plastic islands. Ocean currents cause “gyres” where the plastic accumulates. One of these islands is already the size of the United States.
